description: "Build and integrate Stream Chat, Video, and Feeds in Android apps. Use for Jetpack Compose, Android Studio, and Gradle project work — including Stream package setup, auth and token wiring, screen blueprints, and any follow-up Stream UI work such as adding screens, navigating between channel list and channel/message screens, channel tap handling, deep links, push routing, theming, custom channel/message UI, video calling flows (joining/starting calls, ringing, custom call controls and participant tiles), and Feeds surfaces (timeline, activity composer, threaded comments, follow graph / profile, notification feed, stories)."
license: See LICENSE in repository root
compatibility: Requires an Android Studio / Gradle project (Kotlin). The `stream` CLI (binary name `stream`, installed from `getstream.io/cli/install.sh`) is the default path for the credentials flow (API key fetch, token mint, and any product-specific setup — see `credentials.md`); only optional when the user pastes the API key and token themselves.

# Stream Android - skill router + execution flow

**Rules:** Read **[`RULES.md`](RULES.md)** once per session - every non-negotiable rule is stated there, nowhere else.

This file is the **single entrypoint**: intent classification, local project detection, and module pointers for Stream work in Android apps.

---

## Step 0: Intent classifier (mandatory first - never skip)

Before any tool call, decide the **track** from the user's input alone - no probes first.

### Signals -> track

| Signal in user input | Track |
|---|---|
| Explicit product/framework token: `Chat Compose`, `Chat XML`, `Video Android`, `Video Compose`, `Feeds Android`, `Feeds Compose`, etc. | **C - Reference lookup** |
| Words "docs" or "documentation" around Stream Android/Compose work | **C - Reference lookup** |
| "How do I {X} in Compose/XML/Android?", "What does {SDK type/Composable/View/Fragment} do?" | **C - Reference lookup** |
| "Build me a new Android app", "create a Compose app", "new Android app" + Stream product | **A - New app** |
| "Add/integrate Stream into this app", "wire Chat/Video/Feeds into my Android project" | **B - Existing app** |
| "Install Stream packages", "set up Stream in Android Studio", "wire auth/token flow" with no broader feature request | **D - Bootstrap / setup** |
| Bare `/stream-android` with no args | List the tracks briefly and wait |

### Disambiguation flow

If the request is ambiguous between **build/integrate** and **reference lookup**, ask one short question and wait:

> Do you want me to wire this into the project, or just map the Android SDK pattern and files?

### After classification

- **Tracks A, B, D** -> run **Step 0.5 (credentials)** first, **then Project signals** once per session, then continue in [`builder.md`](builder.md) and [`sdk.md`](sdk.md). Do not probe the project before credentials.
- **Track C** -> skip both steps if the product + UI layer are explicit. Only run Project signals on demand if the SDK or UI layer is ambiguous.

---

## Step 0.5: Credentials, token, and seed data (tracks A, B, D only)

**Order:** intent classification -> **Step 0.5 (this step)** -> Project signals probe -> track work. Do this **before** running the Project signals shell command, even if a track table below lists "Detect" as phase 1. Run **once per session** for tracks A, B, and D. Skip for Track C.

Follow [`credentials.md`](credentials.md) to:

- collect the Stream API key from the dashboard (or from the user)
- generate a user token via the Stream CLI (or accept one from the user)
- run any product-specific setup (Chat: optionally seed channels; Feeds: confirm feed groups; Video: nothing — calls are ephemeral)

Use the resulting API key and token in every code snippet — never placeholder strings. If a track A/B/D task reaches code work and credentials haven't been collected yet, return to `credentials.md` before continuing.

---

## Project signals (tracks A/B/D - once per session; Track C on demand only)

Read-only local probe. Use it to detect whether the user is in an Android Studio / Gradle project, a Kotlin module, or an empty directory.

```bash
bash -c 'echo "=== GRADLE ROOT ==="; find . -maxdepth 2 \( -name "settings.gradle.kts" -o -name "settings.gradle" -o -name "build.gradle.kts" -o -name "build.gradle" \) -print 2>/dev/null; echo "=== APP MODULES ==="; find . -maxdepth 3 -type f \( -name "build.gradle.kts" -o -name "build.gradle" \) -path "*/*/build.gradle*" -print 2>/dev/null; echo "=== VERSION CATALOG ==="; find . -maxdepth 3 -name "libs.versions.toml" -print 2>/dev/null; echo "=== MANIFESTS ==="; find . -maxdepth 4 -name "AndroidManifest.xml" -print 2>/dev/null; echo "=== EMPTY ==="; test -z "$(ls -A 2>/dev/null)" && echo "EMPTY_CWD" || echo "NON_EMPTY"'
```

Hold the result in conversation context. Don't re-run it unless the user changes directory or the project shape clearly changed.

Use the result to produce a **one-line status**, for example:

- `Compose app detected - app/build.gradle.kts - libs.versions.toml present - ready for Stream wiring`
- `Multi-module Gradle project detected - preserve existing module layout`
- `XML / View-based app detected - keep current UI layer unless the user asks to migrate`
- `No Gradle project found - user needs to create the app in Android Studio first`

---

## Module map

| Track | Module(s) |
|---|---|
| A - New app | [`builder.md`](builder.md) + [`sdk.md`](sdk.md) + relevant reference files |
| B - Existing app | [`builder.md`](builder.md) + [`sdk.md`](sdk.md) + relevant reference files |
| C - Reference lookup | [`sdk.md`](sdk.md) + relevant reference files |
| D - Bootstrap / setup | [`builder.md`](builder.md) + [`sdk.md`](sdk.md) |

---

## Reference layout

Shared Android/Kotlin patterns live in **[`sdk.md`](sdk.md)**.

Product and UI-layer specifics live under **`references/`** using a flat naming scheme that can grow with the full Stream Android surface:

- **Reference:** `references/<PRODUCT>-<UI_LAYER>.md`
- **Blueprints:** `references/<PRODUCT>-<UI_LAYER>-blueprints.md`

Current extracted modules:

- **Chat + Compose:** [`references/CHAT-COMPOSE.md`](references/CHAT-COMPOSE.md) + [`references/CHAT-COMPOSE-blueprints.md`](references/CHAT-COMPOSE-blueprints.md)
- **Chat + XML:** [`references/CHAT-XML.md`](references/CHAT-XML.md) + [`references/CHAT-XML-blueprints.md`](references/CHAT-XML-blueprints.md)
- **Video + Compose:** [`references/VIDEO-COMPOSE.md`](references/VIDEO-COMPOSE.md) + [`references/VIDEO-COMPOSE-blueprints.md`](references/VIDEO-COMPOSE-blueprints.md)
- **Feeds + Compose:** [`references/FEEDS-COMPOSE.md`](references/FEEDS-COMPOSE.md) + [`references/FEEDS-COMPOSE-blueprints.md`](references/FEEDS-COMPOSE-blueprints.md)

> **Feeds has no pre-built UI components.** `FEEDS-COMPOSE.md` covers the headless data SDK (FeedsClient, FeedState, ActivityState); `FEEDS-COMPOSE-blueprints.md` is custom Composable scaffolding driven by those state flows. Load both for any Feeds request.

Future Android product coverage should stay in this naming family instead of creating more top-level skills.

If the requested product/UI layer file is not bundled yet, say so plainly, use `sdk.md` for the shared Android patterns, and only switch to live docs if the user asks.

---

## Track A - New app

**Full detail:** [`builder.md`](builder.md) - use the **new-project path**.

| Phase | Name | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** | Detect | After **Step 0.5 (credentials)**, run **Project signals**. If there is no Android app yet, tell the user to create one in Android Studio first. |
| **A2** | Choose lane | Confirm product(s) and UI layer: Compose, XML/Views, or mixed. |
| **A3** | Install + wire | Follow [`builder.md`](builder.md) + [`sdk.md`](sdk.md), then load only the needed product references. |
| **A4** | Verify | Confirm Gradle sync, `ChatClient` lifetime, auth, and first rendered screen. |

---

## Track B - Existing app

**Full detail:** [`builder.md`](builder.md) - use the **existing-project path**.

| Phase | Name | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** | Detect | After **Step 0.5 (credentials)**, run **Project signals** and inspect the existing app structure before editing. |
| **B2** | Preserve | Keep the current UI layer, dependency strategy (version catalog vs inline), and navigation setup unless the user asks for a migration. |
| **B3** | Integrate | Use [`sdk.md`](sdk.md) for shared wiring, then load only the needed product reference files. |
| **B4** | Verify | Confirm the requested Stream flow builds and renders inside the existing app. |

---

## Track C - Reference lookup

Load only the relevant files for the requested product and UI layer.

- Shared lifecycle / auth / state patterns -> [`sdk.md`](sdk.md)
- Chat Compose setup and gotchas -> [`references/CHAT-COMPOSE.md`](references/CHAT-COMPOSE.md)
- Chat Compose screen structure -> [`references/CHAT-COMPOSE-blueprints.md`](references/CHAT-COMPOSE-blueprints.md)
- Chat XML setup and gotchas -> [`references/CHAT-XML.md`](references/CHAT-XML.md)
- Chat XML screen structure -> [`references/CHAT-XML-blueprints.md`](references/CHAT-XML-blueprints.md)
- Video Compose setup and gotchas -> [`references/VIDEO-COMPOSE.md`](references/VIDEO-COMPOSE.md)
- Video Compose call/screen structure -> [`references/VIDEO-COMPOSE-blueprints.md`](references/VIDEO-COMPOSE-blueprints.md)
- Feeds Compose SDK patterns -> [`references/FEEDS-COMPOSE.md`](references/FEEDS-COMPOSE.md)
- Feeds Compose blueprints -> [`references/FEEDS-COMPOSE-blueprints.md`](references/FEEDS-COMPOSE-blueprints.md)

If the user asks for a product/UI-layer combo that is not bundled (e.g. Video XML, Feeds XML), say that clearly instead of inventing API details.

---

## Track D - Bootstrap / setup

Use when the user wants the install and wiring path more than a feature build:

- run **Step 0.5 (credentials)** first
- detect the project shape
- choose Compose vs XML ownership
- install Stream packages with the project's existing dependency strategy (version catalog or inline)
- wire auth and `ChatClient` lifetime via [`sdk.md`](sdk.md)
- stop before product-specific UI if the user only asked for setup
